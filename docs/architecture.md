# Halley architecture

Halley uses balanced subsystem boundaries: modules are large enough to keep a
complete policy visible, but platform, presentation, shell UI, and protocol
state do not share implementation files.

## Dependency direction

- `session` owns compositor policy and coordinates subsystems.
- `session::RuntimeSettings`, `session::InteractionState`, and
  `shell::ShellState` own configuration reload, compositor-owned input
  transactions, and renderer-independent shell state respectively. They keep
  those lifecycles out of the flat session coordinator.
- `backend` owns only TTY/winit, output, DMA-BUF, frame submission, DPMS, and
  VRR mechanics. Backends implement segregated render, output, and lifecycle
  driver contracts. TTY output and DMA-BUF policy live below `backend::tty`.
- `presentation` owns camera transforms plus shared window and field-maximize
  presentation state used by rendering and input mapping.
- `render` owns scene composition and dedicated persistent GPU resources for
  backgrounds, effects, decorations, textures, text, nodes, and shell UI.
- `window` owns backend-neutral managed-window rules and initial routing.
  Wayland and XWayland supply identities and apply the resolved policy without
  maintaining separate rule engines.
- `shell` owns renderer-independent overlay, bearings, focus-cycle, and Apogee
  state. Their GLES presentation lives below `render`.
- `capture` owns screenshot selection, a separate portal source-chooser state
  machine, pixel capture, and screencast buffers. Screenshot and portal chrome
  have independent render modules and share only capture icon assets.
- `wayland` and `xwayland` own protocol transactions. XWayland control
  properties, managed state, configure constraints, lifecycle,
  override-redirect policy, and presentation policy are separate. X11
  fullscreen selection is a pure policy object; event handling only applies
  its result.
- `session::input` owns raw device-event coordination. Keyboard modal routing
  and configured compositor actions are separate state-machine and action
  modules beneath it.
- `animation` owns pure timelines. Rendering consumes animation output but
  animation code does not know about GLES or backends.
- `halley-cli` separates command parsing, help, response presentation,
  configuration diagnostics, and IPC transport. Node parsing has its own
  command module; the executable entry point only dispatches typed actions.

One `RenderState` owns persistent GPU caches. A frame crosses the
session/render boundary through six contexts: frame, desktop, cursor, overlays,
visual configuration, and mutable render resources.

Pointer confinement and locking are a protected boundary. Their lifecycle and
motion algorithms remain in `session::pointer::constraints`; presentation
adapters may be called by that subsystem, but rendering and refactors must not
own or duplicate constraint policy.

## Quality rubric

Scores use a ten-point scale and are gated separately; an average cannot hide
a category below 8.

| Category | Score | Evidence |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Cohesion | 8.4 | Input actions, keyboard routing, runtime settings, input interactions, shell state, and X11 fullscreen policy each have one explicit owner; protocol event loops remain intentionally cohesive assemblers |
| Coupling | 8.0 | The flat `Session` surface fell from 54 to 38 fields; backend policy depends on segregated render/output/lifecycle contracts; helper lookups receive explicit subsystems instead of the whole session |
| Maintainability | 8.3 | Typed/validated config, 800+ focused tests, documented invariants, pure policy seams, full workspace regression tests, formatting, production build, and strict clippy gates protect incremental changes |

The scores are deliberately close to the threshold rather than aspirational.
Smithay protocol handlers still require the complete session type, and the
remaining large orchestration files are `session/input.rs`,
`wayland/fullscreen.rs`, `clusters/mod.rs`, `render/scene.rs`, and the TTY
session/backend drivers. Input delegates keyboard and action policy but its raw
pointer loop is still large. Future feature work should add narrow policy or
transaction objects instead of growing those assemblers in place.

## SOLID application

- Single responsibility: runtime settings, interaction state, shell state,
  keyboard routing, action routing, and X11 presentation policy have separate
  owners.
- Open/closed and substitution: fullscreen decisions and backend capabilities
  are selected through typed policy/driver contracts; new policy cases or
  backends do not require duplicating the session event loops.
- Interface segregation: render/DMA-BUF, output hardware, and session lifecycle
  are separate driver traits.
- Dependency inversion: backend-independent session policy depends on those
  contracts, while TTY and winit provide the concrete mechanics.

## Change gates

Before merging architectural or rendering changes:

1. `cargo fmt --all -- --check`
2. `cargo test --workspace`
3. `cargo build -p halley`
4. `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`

Configuration syntax and IPC enum ordering are compatibility surfaces. IPC
remains at version 10 unless a deliberate wire-format change is made.
