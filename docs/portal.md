# Screen sharing and the desktop portal

Halley's desktop portal is the safe bridge used by OBS, browsers, and chat
applications when they ask to capture the desktop. The application does not
choose a compositor surface directly. Halley opens its own modal chooser and
returns only the source the user confirms.

## Choosing a source

When an application supports both source types, the chooser first shows a
bottom bar:

- **Monitor** enters monitor-picking mode.
- **Window** enters window-picking mode.

If the application already requests only monitors or only windows, Halley
enters that picking mode directly and does not place a second source-category
menu over the application's own chooser. Use the pointer or Left/Right and
Enter. Escape returns from a picking mode to the bottom bar only for requests
that support both source types; otherwise it cancels the request.

Monitor and window picking dim everything outside the candidate. This is only
chooser chrome and is never included in the resulting stream.

## OBS

Add a **Screen Capture (PipeWire)** source in OBS. Halley's Monitor/Window bar
should appear, followed by the appropriate click-to-pick mode. Once confirmed,
OBS receives a live PipeWire stream. Closing the OBS source closes the portal
session and removes its PipeWire node.

The portal supports hidden, embedded, and metadata cursor modes. The requesting
application chooses the mode; no Halley configuration key is required.

Halley prefers DMA-BUF buffers and acknowledges each capture only after the
renderer fence signals. PipeWire therefore queues a frame only when its GPU
work is complete; mapped shared memory remains a compatibility fallback.
The portal queries the compositor's render device and supported modifiers
before allocating, so nested/software sessions fall back safely and multi-GPU
systems never guess a render node.

PipeWire frames use the standard variable-framerate/max-framerate fields and
carry header and full-damage metadata. DMA-BUF chunks remain explicitly
nonempty even though their modifier-dependent allocation size is not expressed
as `stride * height`; this matches the established wlr/Hyprland portal
contract used by OBS.

Capture is consumer-driven. A compositor frame is produced only when PipeWire
requests a buffer, at the negotiated rate up to 60 frames per second. There is
no continuously refreshed full-output CPU cache or per-frame compositor
connection.

## Session routing

`XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP` must include `Halley`, and the installed
`halley-portals.conf` routes the ScreenCast and Screenshot interfaces to
`xdg-desktop-portal-halley`. Distribution packages install the matching D-Bus
and systemd user-service files from `packaging/`.

The compositor and portal use a versioned local capture protocol. When testing
a newly built compositor in an existing graphical session, restart
`xdg-desktop-portal-halley.service` as well; a portal process left running from
an older build cannot serve captures for the new compositor.
