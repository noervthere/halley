//! Stable, Rust-first client API for controlling and observing Halley.
//!
//! [`Client`] keeps one direct Unix-socket connection open for commands and
//! queries. [`Client::subscribe`] creates a second dedicated connection and
//! returns an initial snapshot followed by sequenced, typed changes.
